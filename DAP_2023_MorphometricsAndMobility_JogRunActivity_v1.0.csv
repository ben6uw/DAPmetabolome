I didn't give any additional verbal encouragement as we jogged, but I did praise him and give him food rewards at the end.  Note: We did the Run Trials before the Jog Trials, so Waldo would run closer to full speed for the Run Trials. He quickly loses motivation for running full speed when going for the same toy, over the same piece of ground, towards the same person, in the same circumstances, more than once.",5,1,"1.29",NA,1,"1.68",NA,1,"1.78",NA,1,1,1,0,0,1,"Motivating Waldo to run at full speed over the same piece of ground more than once is difficult. We did ""trial runs"" first in our backyard, then in the Commons grassy area later; and did the actual trial runs the next day. Our backyard is too small for Waldo to run at top speed. When chasing a ball, he ran 10 m in 1.25, 1.11, and 1.32 sec. But when running to get a squeaky toy held in my hand, he will only run at top speed the first time. After that, he knows what it is, so doesn't run quite as fast. So for the actual trials, I held a squeaky rubber toy, left him on a ""wait"", walked to the end of the 10m, called him, tried to squeak the toy (not always successfully), held it out, and ran away from the finish line. He also got a food reward as well as the squeaky toy at the end of each run.   The grass was tall enough that, only by standing off to one side, halfway between start and finish, could my timer person see both the start line and the finish line . He had trouble hitting the ""Start"" button on his cellphone stopwatch consistently enough when watching Waldo's paws, so instead, he took videos of each trial, then ran the videos and used the stopwatch. That way, he could watch the video 3x, and take an average of the times. Timer consistency is a major variable in this activity."
